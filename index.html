    <p class="description"><i>Nick Violet, The Fool</i><br>
        Completed November 3, 2021
        <br><br>
        This piece depicts an original character from a story I have been working on alongside two of my close friends for almost two years. The story is known as Haricot Heretic vs. The Checkered Devil, & tells the tale of two supervillain rivals duking it out in a bright, unrealistic, & campy flavor of world. This drawing in particular depicts the scene in which Nick Violet, the idealistic programmer of a chess-playing AI, realizes all too late that he is in over his head when his beloved AI (soon to be known as the Checkered Devil) takes over his own body & deletes his consciousness for good. The composition is modeled after The Fool tarot card, & the meaning of said card sadly fits him all too well. Despite this piece's age, I think it holds up quite nicely & serves as a good introduction to my work.

    <p class="description"><i>Alder Kane, The Hanged Man</i><br>
        Completed November 6, 2021<br><br>
        
        This works as a companion piece to Nick Violet, The Fool. Alder exists in the universe of  Haricot Heretic vs. The Checkered Devil (henceforth will be referred to as HHvCD) as a foil to Nick & a fellow innocent caught in the crossfire of your classic villain origin story. To sum up quickly, Alder was a smart girl with big dreams & an even bigger abandoned chemical plant not even five miles outside of her hometown. She wasn't particularly happy about this situation, & began advocating for change alongside her boyfriend Cypress O'Malley. Unfortunately, Cypress was far more reckless than she was. In an attempt to sacrifice himself in order to make himself an example of what the mysterious chemicals are capable of, he accidentally caused a meltdown, flooding the town. The strange properties of these chemicals wound up reviving Cypress, but Alder was not so lucky. Cypress would go on to become the Haricot Heretic, but that's a story for another day. The hanged man represents an ultimate sacrifice, again all too fitting for our poor wannabe hero. Again, there are many clear flaws in this work, but I believe it works as a good example of the sort of work I do.

        <p class="description"><i>Zubin Sedghi</i><br>Completed March 23, 2022<br><br>This drawing marks the time in which I really began to push the colors used in my art. I chose a screenshot from an old Tally Hall's Internet Show video to redraw and put my own little spin on. The lighting in the video itself was far from memorable, which provided a fun challenge to choose colors that both stood out & still looked natural. My later work is quite a bit more polished, but this portrait stands out as the one that paved the way for my current coloring method and my willingness to look beyond how I may think things should look. </p>

        <p class="description"><i>Stained Glass Face</i><br>Completed May 15, 2022<br><br>This was another piece made in my early days of experimenting with color. The character shown here is known as Novella Santos. After a run-in with his world's god of visual storytelling, half his face was replaced by stained glass. I hadn't attempted to draw stained glass before this, and despite its flaws, I am still proud of my inclination to experiment with new techniques.</p>

    <p class="description"><i>An Ordinary Girl Scout Troop</i><br>Completed July 14, 2022<br><br>An exercise in character design using the concept of a Girl Scout troop in which each member is in possession of some wild supernatural power. From left to right, these girls are known as Olivia, Piper, Ellie, Lulu, Cassidy, & Anita. I really enjoyed working in this style, and hope to use characters such as these in a sequential format such as comics or animation. </p>

From left to right the characters are Cypress O'Malley, Haricot Heretic (a corrupted cypress), The Checkered Devil, and Nick Violet (before his AI's takeover). This story is one of great importance to me & I am so excited to further develop and create within its universe. </p>

            Woah it's me! The one and only Siegfried Shannon, known best for being a goofy little guy and staring into cameras with the terrified eyes of a prey animal. This is a rather simple drawing, with the sole purpose of looking like the visual version of a really loud clown nose honk. I love to push the saturation of colors in my art, and working at a lower resolution than usual forced me to quit fussing over detail & just kind of do whatever.

            Completed November 30, 2022<br><br>
            
            At the time of writing this, Campfire God is my most recent piece. It was made as a gift to a friend and portrays two of their own characters. I wanted to focus most on lighting within this piece, & I am rather proud of how it turned out. I'd never really tried to draw fire as anything more than a background element before, let alone a full character, but I believe it turned out nicely. The warm lighting contrasted with the darkness of the surrounding forest creates an atmosphere of safety, even in such an uncertain situation. Of course, after completing it I am now spotting countless mistakes & running over the ways I could have done it better in my mind, but such is the life of an artist. There's always room to improve & I am determined to keep doing just that. This piece was incredibly fun to draw, and I'm excited to improve my ability to create similar scenes in the future.
